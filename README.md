# Smash-em-bash-em-cyborgs

My rendition of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, made in Unity for a Game Development Course.

To play the game, select the "Main Menu" scene inside of Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.  
Please ensure you have the editor window scale set to WXGA (1366x768), as the UI was optimized for this resolution.

More information about the game can be found in Assignment3_ChristianCatalano-1120832.pdf, including state machines, asset design, controls, and features.
